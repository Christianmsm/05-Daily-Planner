# 05-Daily-Planner

## Description

This project we were tasked with creating a daily planner application that the user can add tasks in the text fields that will then be saved and stored in the local storage. 

How I went about completting this task was I worked in the HTML file to get the header element aligned in the center, then I created all of the div elements for the hours of 9am - 5pm.

I then started working in the JavaScript file to display the current date on the header element, then worked on creating click evens for each of the buttons with the corresponding hours.

I then made sure the elements were saved to the localStorage after the button is clicked.

I definitely ran into issues with displaying the correct color class if the hour was "past, present, or future." I will go back and figure out how to get this functioning properly.
